A Time Series is defined as a series of data points recorded at different time intervals. The time order can be daily, monthly, or even yearly.
Time Series forecasting is the process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time series based on past results.
Forecasting is the step where we want to predict the future values the series is going to take. 
Forecasting a time series is often of tremendous commercial value.
